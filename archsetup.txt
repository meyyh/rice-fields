add nvidia_drm.modeset=1 in grub cfg according to hyprland wiki


also install and enable os-prober

also add options nvidia-drm modeset=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf

then regen cpio

starting aosp and setting git uname and email

nvm i got the pdf reader to install

now i setup xdg-user-dirs: run xdg-user-dirs-update

install vscodium

wayland version crashes

fix it by adding
-------------------------------
{
  "window.titleBarStyle": "custom",
  ...
}
-------------------------------

to .config/VSCodium/User/settings.json

for normal vscode replace VSCodium with code

start making task/calender app with qt cpp and cmake

needed to install qt5/6-wayland

nvm thats hard we using thunderbird for email and tasks

now i install japanese font so instead of not understanding ascii error i can enjoy not understanding japanese but i can copy and paste (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧

lol the ascii is broke without jp font

install ttf-hanazono ttf-symbola for ascii emojis

install ttf-font-awesome for waybar but its using jp text for icons? tries to install ttf-jetbrains-mono did not help will fix this later

to fix workspaces edit /etc/xdg/waybar/config and chage sway/workspaces to hyprland/workspaces

now we steam ahead with sl jk were installing steam and pick nvidia option cus you know nvidia gpu

conda activate sd

conda install -c conda-forge gcc=

edit webui-user.sh to venv=-

well it works but the default model sucks so test it with something else

now onto gpu passthrough yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay (I enjoy pain TᴖT)

here is a link that helped me last time
https://blandmanstudios.medium.com/tutorial-the-ultimate-linux-laptop-for-pc-gamers-feat-kvm-and-vfio-dee521850385

first we install qemu-full and virt-manager

Total Download Size:    171.37 MiB
Total Installed Size:  1112.02 MiB
wut

L systemcrash during install going to try updateing before see if that helps

system update did nothing just texinfo and qemu+virt manager installed fine so i guess were good?

sudo systemctl enable & start libvird

sudo usermod -aG libvirt USER so you dont need to enter root passwd

here comes my first issue with the guide it tells you to put "intel_iommu=on iommu=pt rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau modprobe.blacklist=nouveau nvidia-drm.modeset=1 vfio-pci.ids=10de:25a0,10de:2291 module_blacklist=nouveau" in your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX how do we figuew out what vfio-pci.ids to put run this command lspci -nnk ok but what ones lol get fucked mabye its in a different spot in the video but it should be there when he tells us about it so on to the arch wiki

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF bless this page i highly recomend reading it as its been very helpful for me when im confused on thing

the page does mention gpu-passthrough-manager but i never got it to work

quick aside im running an i5-12600k and rtx 2070 if you have an amd cpu or gpu or nvidia card older than 20 series you will likely have some different steps somewhere so just be aware of that

also


    Options in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX are always effective
    Options in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT are effective ONLY during normal boot (NOT during recovery mode).



first thing we need to do is enable iommu so we are going to add all of the things the guide says but the pci ids to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub

so the line should look something like this GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet nvidia_drm.modeset=1 intel_iommu=on iommu=pt rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau modprobe.blacklist=nouveau module_blacklist=nouveau"

now reboot and pray to arch-chan

i must of not prayed hard enough as shit no workey

you can test it with the commands and scripts in the vfio arch wiki

no im just a fucking idjit and forgot to regen grub cfg

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


also do git config --global core.editor "vim"
